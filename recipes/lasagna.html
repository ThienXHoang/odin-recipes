        <li>Pinch of sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For the Cheese Mixture:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (15 oz) carton ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <li>For Assembly:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>9-12 lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <p>Prepare the sauce:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
          ground beef, Italian sausage, and diced onion. Cook until the meat is
          browned and the onion is translucent, breaking the meat into small
          pieces. Drain any excess fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water (if
          using). Season with parsley, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper,
          and an optional pinch of sugar.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Prepare the Cheese Mixture and Noodles:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          While the sauce simmers, in a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese,
          beaten egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using regular noodles, cook them in a large pot of salted boiling
          water according to package directions until *al dente*. Drain and
          rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. (Skip this step if using
          no-boil noodles).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Bake and Serve</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil (spray the underside
          of the foil with non-stick spray to prevent the cheese from sticking).
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until the
          cheese is golden brown and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the lasagna **rest for at least 15 minutes** before slicing and
          serving. This is crucial for the layers to set and prevents it from
          being soupy.
        </li>
      </ol>
